# Introduction

A skill is a set of instructions - packaged as a simple folder - that teaches Claude
how to handle specific tasks or workflows. Skills are one of the most powerful
ways to customize Claude for your specific needs. Instead of re-explaining your
preferences, processes, and domain expertise in every conversation, skills let you
teach Claude once and benefit every time.
Skills are powerful when you have repeatable workflows: generating frontend
designs from specs, conducting research with consistent methodology, creating
documents that follow your team's style guide, or orchestrating multi-step
processes. They work well with Claude's built-in capabilities like code execution
and document creation. For those building MCP integrations, skills add another
powerful layer helping turn raw tool access into reliable, optimized workflows.
This guide covers everything you need to know to build effective skills - from
planning and structure to testing and distribution. Whether you're building a
skill for yourself , your team, or for the community , you'll find practical patterns
and real-world examples throughout.
## What you'll learn
• Technical requirements and best practices for skill structure
• Patterns for standalone skills and MCP-enhanced workflows
• Patterns we've seen work well across different use cases
• How to test, iterate, and distribute your skills
## Who this is for
• Developers who want Claude to follow specific workflows consistently
• Power users who want Claude to follow specific workflows
• Teams looking to standardize how Claude works across their organization
## Two Paths Through This Guide
Building standalone skills? Focus on Fundamentals, Planning and Design, and
category 1-2. Enhancing an MCP integration? The "Skills + MCP" section and
category 3 are for you. Both paths share the same technical requirements, but
you choose what's relevant to your use case.
What you'll get out of this guide: By the end, you'll be able to build a functional
skill in a single sitting. Expect about 15-30 minutes to build and test your first
working skill using the skill-creator .
Let's get started.
