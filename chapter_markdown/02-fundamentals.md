# Fundamentals

## What is a skill?
A skill is a folder containing:
• SKILL.md (required): Instructions in Markdown with YAML frontmatter
• scripts/ (optional): Executable code (Python, Bash, etc.)
• references/ (optional): Documentation loaded as needed
• assets/ (optional): Templates, fonts, icons used in output
## Core design principles
### Progressive Disclosure
Skills use a three-level system:
• First level (YAML frontmatter): Always loaded in Claude's system prompt.
Provides just enough information for Claude to know when each skill should
be used without loading all of it into context.
• Second level (SKILL.md body): Loaded when Claude thinks the skill is
relevant to the current task. Contains the full instructions and guidance.
• Third level (Linked files): Additional files bundled within the skill directory
that Claude can choose to navigate and discover only as needed.
This progressive disclosure minimizes token usage while maintaining
specialized expertise.
### Composability
Claude can load multiple skills simultaneously . Your skill should work well
alongside others, not assume it's the only capability available.
### Portability
Skills work identically across Claude.ai, Claude Code, and API. Create a skill once
and it works across all surfaces without modification, provided the environment
supports any dependencies the skill requires.
## For MCP Builders: Skills + Connectors
💡 Building standalone skills without MCP? Skip to Planning and Design - you can
always return here later.
If you already have a working MCP server, you've done the hard part. Skills are
the knowledge layer on top - capturing the workflows and best practices you
already know , so Claude can apply them consistently .
### The kitchen analogy
MCP provides the professional kitchen: access to tools, ingredients, and
equipment.
Skills provide the recipes: step-by-step instructions on how to create something
valuable.

Together , they enable users to accomplish complex tasks without needing to
figure out every step themselves.
### How they work together
MCP (Connectivity) Skills (Knowledge)
Connects Claude to your service
(Notion, Asana, Linear, etc.)
Teaches Claude how to use your service
effectively
Provides real-time data access and tool
invocation
Captures workflows and best practices
What Claude can do How Claude should do it
### Why this matters for your MCP users
#### Without skills
• Users connect your MCP but don't know what to do next
• Support tickets asking "how do Ido Xwith your integration"
• Each conversation starts from scratch
• Inconsistent results because users prompt differently each time
• Users blame your connector when the real issue is workflow guidance
#### With skills
• Pre-built workflows activate automatically when needed
• Consistent, reliable tool usage
• Best practices embedded in every interaction
• Lower learning curve for your integration
